# Apple Notes to markdown shortcut (Apple Shortcuts)

This is a simple Apple Shortcut that will convert all of the notes in your notes folder to markdown.

When you import this shortcut, it will ask where you want to save your exported notes. The exported notes will go into a subfolder called "notes-export" so keep that in mind when selecting a folder.

The shortcut names the file tmp.txt because the file shortcut doesn't allow saving any other file type (as far as I can tell--if you know otherwise please let me know!). We then rename the tmp.txt file to the actual note name and change the extension to .md
